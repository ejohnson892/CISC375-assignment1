                    During high school I really liked playing video games, and all of my friends had their own computer,
                    so in 11th grade I decided to build my own. It was the most fun project I have ever worked on and
                    I overcame a lot of challenges along the way. I learned so much while researching and buying and
                    buying parts, and soon after completing my own I helped my sister build a computer as well.
                    Successfully building my own computer has had a big impact in my life, being one of the main reasons
                    I decided to major in computer science.

                    Another project that really got me into computers and programming was the game design class I took
                    in 10th grade. Using a platform called "Construct3" I coded my own video game over the course of a
                    couple months. At the end of the class, I submitted my game to a national competition, where I
                    placed in the top 12! The joy I found in creating something that other people enjoyed motivates me
                    in every project I do.

                    This project is not related to computer science, but is still one of the projects I am most proud
                    of. My senior year of high school I was one of the three DECA Presidents at my high school, and we
                    ran the DECA program of over 100 students. Over the course of 6 months we worked on a business
                    operations plan with a local business, and then took that 20-page paper and 15 minute presentation to
                    competition. After winning state we competed at internationals, where we placed in the top 15 teams
                    in the world.
